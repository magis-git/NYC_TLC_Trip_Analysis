# Introduction

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

Understanding passenger behavior and operational performance is crucial for enhancing service quality, optimizing operational efficiency, and increasing customer satisfaction. Insights derived from this analysis can guide strategic decisions in areas such as scheduling, pricing, marketing, and service improvements.
